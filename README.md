## Requirements
- Android 7.0 (Nougat) or higher (Min SDK 24)
- Kotlin 1.5.1 or higher

<!-- Open-Source Libraries -->
## Open-Source Libraries
* Minimum SDK level 26
* [Dependency Injection (Hilt) (2.51.1)](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - Used for dependency injection, simplifying the management of application components.
* [Jetpack Compose (1.9.1)](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose) - A modern toolkit for building native UI in Android.
* [Compose Lifecycle (2.8.4)](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/lifecycle) - Manages lifecycle-aware components in Jetpack Compose.
* [MVVM](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel#implement) - A design pattern used to separate concerns, making the application more modular, testable, and maintainable.
  * [Lifecycle (2.8.4)](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - Manages Android lifecycle-aware components.
  * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores
      UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
  * [UseCases](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/domain-layer) - Located domain
      layer that sits between the UI layer and the data layer.
  * [Repository](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/data-layer) - Located in the data
      layer that contains application data and business logic.
* [Coil (2.6.0)](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/compose/) - An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.

<!-- Architecture -->
## Architecture
This Android app uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern and Clean Architecture principles, organized into four main modules for better scalability and maintainability.

MVVM

- Model: Manages data and business logic, separate from the UI.
- View: Displays the data and interacts with the user.
- ViewModel: Connects the View and Model, handling UI-related logic and state management.

Clean Architecture & Multi Module
- App Module: The core module that integrates all other modules and provides the main entry point of the application.
- Data Module: Handles data sources, such as APIs and databases, and provides data to the Domain Layer.
- Domain Module: Contains the core business logic and use cases, which are independent of external frameworks.
- Feature Module: Encapsulates the app's features, allowing for modular development and testing of individual functionalities.
